# Ksctl: Simplified Kubernetes Clusters Lifecycle Management


It aims to simplify a collection of kubernetes clusters running on different cloud providers. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing Kubernetes clusters. It is designed to be efficient and can perform tasks quickly and without the need for additional tools. It is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks.

It is already a valuable tool for developers who want to manage Kubernetes clusters using our CLI. And Get started with Kubernetes without thinking about the infrastructure & configurations. Just run `ksctl create` and your cluster is ready to be used be it a local cluster or a cloud provider managed cluster. It makes the developers skip the cluster setup step as well as day 0 work. Soon we will work on day 1 operations and so on üôÇ

So It helps you to avoid using Aws, Azure cli and just create and manage the cluster using a single CLI interface


### So far what have we achieved?
* Cluster Operations
  * Create
  * Delete
  * Get Cluster infra details
  * Storage of state in not just local system but also mongodb
  * Manually Scaleup and Scaledown using the CLI interface
  * Switch Between Clusters
  * Wasm, application stack deployment
* Type Of Cluster
  * Self-Managed HA Cluster
    * K3s
    * Kubeadm
  * Cloud Managed Cluster
    * AKS
    * EKS
    * Civo K3s
* Lifecycle
  * You can now deploy wasm workloads using our Ksctl application stack
  * Common Application Stack Deployment. Example are Argocd, Argorollouts,Kube-Prometheus,etc
  * Initial Prototype of Production Ready Stack (**InProgress**)
  * Etcd Diaster Management (**TBD**)
  * import any cluster (**TBD**)
  * Improved Monitoring of clusters (**In Roadmap**) to make the cluster even more easy to use for someone new to K8s ecosystem
