## üìñ Overview

Ksctl simplifies the management of Kubernetes clusters across different cloud providers through a unified interface. **It focuses on creating cost-efficient and sustainable Kubernetes infrastructure by intelligently optimizing resource selection and deployment.** It eliminates the need for multiple cloud-specific CLIs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and handles the complex infrastructure setup for you.

> [!TIP]
> **Visit [ksctl documentation](https://docs.ksctl.com) for complete guides and examples.**

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Unified Management Interface** - Manage clusters on multiple cloud providers with a single CLI.
- **Rapid Cluster Creation** - Deploy production-ready clusters in 5-10 minutes with `ksctl create`.
- **Multi-Cloud & Cluster Types** - Supports self-managed (K3s, Kubeadm) and managed clusters (AKS, EKS, GKE) across major clouds.
- **Sustainability Focus** - Intelligently selects regions and instances with lower carbon footprints and higher renewable energy usage.
- **Cost Optimization** - Reduces cloud expenses through smart resource selection and dynamic region switching.
- **Simplified Lifecycle Management** - Create, delete, scale, and switch between clusters easily.
- **Application Stack Deployment** - Deploy common applications like GitOps tools and monitoring solutions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![ksctl system architecture][system-level]

## üß© Components

The ksctl ecosystem consists of these main components:

- [**ksctl**][ksctl-gh-link] - Core component for cluster provisioning, Kubernetes bootstrap, cost optimization, and addon management
- [**ksctl/cli**][cli-gh-link] - End-user CLI interface for cluster and addon operations
- [**Ksctl Cluster Management (kcm)**][kcm-gh-link] - Kubernetes controller for managing ksctl-specific cluster addons
- [**Ksctl Application (ka)**][ka-gh-link] - Controller for ksctl application stack functionality

## üöÄ Current Capabilities

- **Cluster Operations**
  - Create, delete, and get cluster infrastructure details
  - State storage in local system or MongoDB
  - Manual scaling up and down via CLI
  - Switch between clusters
  - Wasm and application stack deployment

- **Supported Cluster Types**
  - **Self-Managed HA Clusters**:
    - K3s
    - Kubeadm
  - **Cloud Managed Clusters**:
    - AKS (Azure)
    - EKS (AWS)

- **Lifecycle Management**
  - Deploy Wasm workloads
  - Common application stack deployment (GitOps, monitoring, etc.)
