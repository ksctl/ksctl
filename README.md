It aims to simplify a collection of kubernetes clusters running on different cloud providers. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing Kubernetes clusters. It is designed to be efficient and can perform tasks quickly and without the need for additional tools. It is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks.

It is already a valuable tool for developers who want to manage Kubernetes clusters using our CLI. And Get started with Kubernetes without thinking about the infrastructure & configurations. Just run `ksctl create` and your cluster is ready to be used be it a local cluster or a cloud provider managed cluster. It makes the developers skip the cluster setup step as well as day 0 work. Soon we will work on day 1 operations and so on üôÇ

So It helps you to avoid using Aws, Azure cli and just create and manage the cluster using a single CLI interface


#### ksctl Components

The main components of ksctl include:

- [**ksctl**][ksctl-gh-link]

It is home to cluster provisioner, Kubernetes Bootstrap, cost & optimization management, addon trigger, interface for cli to use

- [**ksctl/cli (cli)**][cli-gh-link]

It contains the end-user CLI interface. It can perform cluster: create, delete, connect, scaleup, scaledown, list, get; addons: enable, disable

- [**Ksctl Cluster Management (kcm)**][kcm-gh-link]

It contains Kubernetes Controller for manageming ksctl specific cluster addons for now ksctl stack is a part of it. In future we are planning for more kubernetes related addons support like unifying EKS, AKS addons as well.

- [**Ksctl Application (ka)**][ka-gh-link]

It has the controller for ksctl application stack functionality


### So far what have we achieved?
* Cluster Operations
  * Create
  * Delete
  * Get Cluster infra details
  * Storage of state in not just local system but also mongodb
  * Manually Scaleup and Scaledown using the CLI interface
  * Switch Between Clusters
  * Wasm, application stack deployment
* Type Of Cluster
  * Self-Managed HA Cluster
    * K3s
    * Kubeadm
  * Cloud Managed Cluster
    * AKS
    * EKS
* Lifecycle
  * You can now deploy wasm workloads using our Ksctl application stack
  * Common Application Stack Deployment. Example are gitops, monitoring, etc [Refer](https://docs.ksctl.com/docs/ksctl-cluster-mgt/stacks/)
